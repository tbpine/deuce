# D&D / Forgotten Realms Tournament Mode for the SaaS

Goal: Add a special "D&D Adventure" mode to make the site appealing to tabletop RPG players (BG3, Forgotten Realms fans). Builds on your existing Swiss format module.

### Why Add This?
- Huge BG3/Forgotten Realms community looking for fun, themed tournament tools.
- Differentiates your site from generic bracket makers.
- Low-to-medium effort (mostly cosmetic + small rule tweaks).
- Ties into your Elminster/BG3 interest without being a full new project.

### Core Features (Start Small)

1. **Themed Templates** (Low effort)
   - Backgrounds: Sword Coast map, Waterdeep skyline, Underdark, Myth Drannor.
   - UI: Dice icons, parchment borders, gold accents.
   - Implementation: CSS theme toggle + free/public domain Faerûn images.

2. **Character Profiles** (Medium effort)
   - Players submit: Name, Class (Fighter, Wizard, etc.), Race, Level, short backstory, avatar.
   - Display in brackets/standings next to player name.
   - Implementation: Add fields to registration form + show in UI.

3. **Honour Mode Variant** (Low effort)
   - Single-elimination or "permadeath" Swiss: one loss = out (or heavy penalty).
   - Leaderboards for longest survival streaks ("Golden Die" style).
   - Implementation: New bracket type toggle.

4. **Custom Tiebreakers / Scoring** (Medium effort)
   - Add RPG flavor: "Treasure Points" (bonus for side objectives), "Divine Favor" (random dice roll).
   - Keep standard Buchholz as base.
   - Implementation: Extend Swiss standings logic.

5. **Side Events / Skill Challenges** (Future / Medium-High effort)
   - Non-combat rounds: Trivia, puzzle submission, "Bardic Performance" (user uploads).
   - Points feed into main standings.
   - Inspiration: Old D&D Championships, Adventurers League.

### Implementation Roadmap (Start Today)
1. **Today/Next Session**: Add theme toggle + 1–2 Faerûn backgrounds. Test on Swiss module.
2. **Next**: Add simple character bio field to registration + display in standings.
3. **Later**: Honour Mode bracket option + custom tiebreakers.

This keeps it fun, ties into your BG3/Elminster vibe, and gives the site a unique niche without turning into another "must finish or fail" pressure project.

You're in the groove—keep it light, do one small piece at a time. The site finishing will feel good because it's for **you** now, not to prove anything.
